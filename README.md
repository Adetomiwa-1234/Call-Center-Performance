# Call-Center-Performance
## Description 
I worked on a call center performance dataset where I handled the full process using Excel and advanced DAX. My focus was to study how customers interacted with the support team across four channels: Call Center, Chatbot, Web, and Email. I explored the patterns in call volume, satisfaction, response time, and reasons for contact. After completing the analysis, I pulled everything together and built an interactive dashboard in Excel that presents the insights in a clear and structured way.
