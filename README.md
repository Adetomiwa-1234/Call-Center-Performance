# Call-Center-Performance
## Description 
I worked on a call center performance dataset where I handled the full process using Excel and advanced DAX. My focus was to study how customers interacted with the support team across four channels: Call Center, Chatbot, Web, and Email. I explored the patterns in call volume, satisfaction, response time, and reasons for contact. After completing the analysis, I pulled everything together and built an interactive dashboard in Excel that presents the insights in a clear and structured way.
## Project Objectives
• Measure the number of calls handled by each channel.

• Identify top reasons for customer contact.

• Track CSAT scores.

• Monitor average call duration and SLA performance.

• Compare performance across regions.
## Tools Used
• Excel for cleaning and transformation

• Excel Pivot Tables and visuals for dashboard design

• DAX functions like CALCULATE and COUNT for metrics

• Conditional formatting and map visuals for insights
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
I handled the data cleaning and preparation with a simple and structured process. I started by checking for missing values to ensure the dataset had no gaps that could affect the analysis. I fixed inconsistent entries and made sure every field followed a uniform format. I standardized all channel names so the analysis would group them correctly. I removed duplicate records to avoid inflated numbers. I converted the date fields to the proper format for accurate time-based insights. I also created calculated fields using DAX to generate the core metrics used in the final dashboard.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
• Distribution of calls by channel

• Regional activity

• Most common reasons for calls

• CSAT score patterns

• SLA performance by channel

• Comparison of call durations
## Major Insights 
• The call center channel had the highest activity

• Email had the lowest volume

• CSAT varied across channels

• Some channels stayed below SLA

• Some regions recorded higher complaint levels
## Recommendations
• Improve response times in channels performing below SLA

• Train agents in regions with high complaint volume

• Focus on channels with low CSAT

• Review workflows for long call durations

• Improve chatbot performance based on escalation patterns
## Conclusion
The analysis gave a clear view of how each support channel performed across the month. The dashboard showed the volume of customer interactions, the top issues raised, and how each channel handled response time and CSAT. These metrics helped highlight strong areas and the points where service dropped below SLA. Leaders can use these insights to improve workflows, strengthen agent support, and raise customer satisfaction across all channels.
